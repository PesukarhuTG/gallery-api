# Image gallery API

### Description
It was a study project on [RSSchool Stage0](https://rs.school/js-stage0/) course. Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/js30%23/js30-5.md)<br>
<br>During a week we created an app in private repository, which is getting data from API (I used [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation)).<br><br>
The task took about 2 days. In [the result](https://pesukarhutg.github.io/gallery-api/) you can see the adaptive app, where user can enter a request and get images.

### Skills
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript + fetch + API(search image via search panel)
